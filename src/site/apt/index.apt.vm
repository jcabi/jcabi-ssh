Java SSH Client

  Read this introduction article:
  {{{http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/02/java-ssh-client.html}Simple Java SSH Client}}.

  It is as simple as this:

+--
import com.jcabi.ssh.Shell;
import com.jcabi.ssh.SSH;
Shell shell = new SSH("example.com", 22, "username", "key...");
String stdout = new Shell.Plain(shell).exec("echo 'Hello, world!'");
+--

  There is also a convenient {{{/apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/ssh/SSHD.html}<<<SSHD>>>}}
  class, a runner of ssh daemon, for unit testing:

+--
try (SSHD sshd = new SSHD()) {
  String uptime = new Shell.Plain(
    SSH(sshd.host(), sshd.login(), sshd.port(), sshd.key())
 ).exec("uptime");
}
+--

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-ssh/${project.version}/jcabi-ssh-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-ssh-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-ssh</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--
